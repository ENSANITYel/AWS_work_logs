Create a total independent linux system to practice bash 
used termux and termux x-11
install ubuntu over termux and running on tablet
installed vscode 
------------------

install chrome 
set up aws on the deck

REASON: embed AI agent to self recognise cases and provide resolution based on DB source 

AI-Powered Incident Management System (Future Rollout Plan)


​Overview: This plan outlines the architecture for upgrading the extension to utilize AI auto-scraping, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Vector Similarity Search. The goal is to scrape HTML content, extract incident context, and dynamically map it to database categories using cosine deviation.


​Phase 1: Auto-Scraping (The Content Script)
​To automate data capture without manual entry, the Chrome Extension API will be utilized to scrape the active page.
​Inject a content.js script into the user's active webpage when the extension is clicked.
​Configure the script to read the DOM and scrape the specific incident ID along with its surrounding description block.
​Pass this raw text payload back to the popup.js frontend via Chrome message passing.


​Phase 2: Meaning Extraction (The LLM Layer)
​Raw HTML scrapes often contain system jargon that needs cleaning.
​Route the raw scraped data from the extension directly to the Express backend.
​Program the backend to make an API call to an external LLM provider.
​Prompt the LLM to analyze the messy text and return a structured summary, such as translating raw logs into "ITM is missing event 15 during create event".


​Phase 3: Vector Embeddings & MongoDB Atlas Integration
​Text summaries must be converted into mathematical arrays (vectors) to compare incident meanings against saved categories.
​Leverage the MongoDB Atlas Free Tier (M0 cluster) environment established in v3.7, which natively supports Atlas Vector Search.
​Command the backend to pass the clean LLM summary to an embedding model, transforming the text into a vector embedding.
​Query this new vector against the existing database of incidents and categories.


​Phase 4: Cosine Deviation & Routing Logic
​Atlas Vector Search compares vectors using Cosine Distance, calculated mathematically as 1 - \text{Cosine Similarity}.
​The backend will determine the relationship between the incident and existing categories using this formula:

Cosine similarity = A.B
                   ----
                   |A||B|

High Deviation< 0.70 (No good match)Trigger new category creationPrompts user to add a new AI-generated category name.

Phase 5: Generating and Saving Records
​The user retains ultimate control over the AI's suggestions.
​Ensure the user reviews and clicks "Approve" when a high deviation triggers a new category suggestion.
​Connect the approval action to the existing POST /categories endpoint from the v3.6 build.
​Save the new category to MongoDB, alongside its generated vector embedding.
​Future highly variable incidents of this specific nature will now perfectly map to this new anchor category with minimal deviation.

​Projections & System Constraints
​Latency: Introducing an LLM and vector embedding model will likely add a slight delay (typically 1-3 seconds) between the user clicking the extension and the UI populating with deductions.
​Storage Limits: High-dimensional vector embeddings consume significantly more database storage; database size must be actively monitored to stay within the MongoDB Atlas 512MB free tier limit.
